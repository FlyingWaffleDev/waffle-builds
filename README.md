FlyingWaffle's personal Gentoo ebuild overlay.

Many ebuilds on this repo are 'live' (9999); take care when using those.
Most ebuilds in this repo have "mirror" or "primaryuri" RESTRICT keywords; in my opinion this should be required for all unofficial overlays since as far as I know only the primary Gentoo repo has sources automatically backed up by mirrors.  I am migrating from "mirror" to "primaryuri" since I have been using it incorrectly.
Quality not guaranteed in any way, shape, or form.
All ebuilds are experimental, your mileage may vary, etc.

Pull requests and bug reports welcome.
